#Full Stack Toronto 2015 Notes

##Always Ship on Time

### User Stories
* Shared vision
* Prioritized by business value

### Conditions of Acceptance (Acceptance Criteria)
* should translate directly into user and/or unit tests

### Estimating User Stories

#### Absolute vs Relative Size
* Absolute = 4 hours, 8 hours, etc.
* we're very bad at estimating absolute, but good at relative estimation
* Cohn scale (read up on Mike Cohn)
* the larger the user story, the higher amount of uncertainty. +-50% difference, so theoretically should even out
* with absolute estimating, it's very dependant on the person doing the estimating; 

#### Estimating Goals
* Encourage discussion
* Involve everyone
* Make it democratic

#### Planning Poker
* Discuss
* Always have the PO involved for questions; but not allowed to estimate

### Estimate Velocity
* Story points per sprint
* **Shippaple** user stories
* Need to understand what is shippable

#### But we haven't started the project yet?
* Run a couple sprints
* Compore to a prior project ( lots of different variables )
* Break down some stories

#### How Big is the box?
* Team capacity => total hours per sprint, total hours dedicated to this project
* Subtract meeting time (standups, sprint planning, etc)
* Net capacity

#### What fits in the box?
* Break things down inton tasks no larger than 4 hours
* example had 4 hours of unit tests for a 12 hours of story
* Estimated 3 user stories
* Figure out what we can do in a sprint, total the user stories

### Trouble with long term estimates...
* Same velocity?
* No changes?
* No surprises?
* How do we limit risk?

### Cone of Uncertainty
* Software Project Survival Guide
* Agile estimating and planning by Mike Cohn
* 0-1 springs = +/- 60%
* 2 sprints = +/0 25%
* Low duration = story points / velocity * 1.6 * sprint length
* High duration = story points / velocity * 0.6 * sprint length
* Example project at start = 4-11 weeks. As sprints happen, can be more accurate
* Huge emphasis that THIS IS THE BEST ESTIMATE WE CAN DO 
* Tell clients only the upper half, while being aware of a possible lower half

### Q & A
* The larger the user story, the large the risk in completing the user story
* Try to get 4-5 stories into a sprint
* Define standards for what is shippable (automated testing, user testing, deployment, documentation, etc)
* Velocity over time incorporates potential time away for employees (takes into account of sick days, conferences, vacation)
* Definition of done - team has to agree and up to the team (including the PO and scrum master)
* Architecture type stuff - how does it fit in? Task => item that only provides value for the team. 
* Yagni => You ain't gonna need it
* Some refactoring is to be expected over time
* For teams working on a number of projects (like us) - scrum may not be the answer! Kanban!
* 1000ft.com, workflowmax
* average velocity should be the average of the last 3 sprints
* sales/estimation. "we tell clients MVP will be between 50k and 100k" and continue conversation from there if they're still interested.

## Work/Life Balance

* "How Many Saturdays do you get?" blogpost
* "Stop treating your employees like factory workers"


## Rethinking Digital News Consumption
* More users coming from mobile than anywhere else
* "Designing for the 24 hour experience" (Jon Setzen - Creative Director from Media Temple)
* "Jobs to be done" - Paul Adams
* Do users read your content the same way on different devices
* "Design containers independant of layout." Konstantin Weiss
* "We moved away from thinking about specific pages on the site and how they might be filled with content"
* "Sometimes you need to make things until you see the thing you really need to make." - @WoodyZuill
* Jobs to be done instead of Personas - could be very different personas, but still require the same "job"
* surveyed 1000 people. Came up with 3 "modes of consumption" (jobs). Update (what's going on?). Extend (learn more about the story). Discover (want to see something I'm interested in)
* Added time to jobs/modes of consumption (update=>short; extend=>more; discover=>most)
* do modes of consumption change during the time of day?
* user satisfaction = perceived time and effort they expect to spend + presentation & variety of content
